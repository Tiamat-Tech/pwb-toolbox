## Arguments

Load daily stock price data for specific symbols using the load_dataset function. The first call retrieves data for Apple and Microsoft. The second call retrieves the same stocks but without price adjustments (`adjust=False`). The third call loads daily price data for the S&P 500 index:

```python
import pwb_toolbox.datasets as pwb_ds

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "Stocks-Daily-Price",
    ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
)

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "Stocks-Daily-Price",
    ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
    adjust=False,
)

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "Stocks-Daily-Price",
    ["sp500"],
)
```

The `extend=True` argument instructs the function to return an extended historical data using indices, commodities, and bonds data.

```python
import pwb_toolbox.datasets as pwb_ds

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "ETFs-Daily-Price",
    ["SPY", "IEF"],
    extend=True,
)
```

The argument `rate_to_price=False` specifies that bond yield rates should not be converted to price values in the returned data:

```python
import pwb_toolbox.datasets as pwb_ds

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "Bonds-Daily-Price",
    ["US10Y"],
    rate_to_price=False,
)
```

The argument `to_usd=False` indicates that the data should not be converted to U.S. dollars, implying that it might be available in another currency.

```python
import pwb_toolbox.datasets as pwb_ds

df = pwb_ds.load_dataset(
    "Indices-Daily-Price",
    ["US10Y"],
    to_usd=False,
)
```
